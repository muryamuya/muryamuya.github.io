## Welcome to My Homepage

I am an innovative and meticulous developer with a passion for design.
Here are various examples of what I have done.

### Electronics
This device works by operating a relay connected to a water pump connected to the sprinklers. The watering time and duration can be set via the device interface as well as the web interface.
